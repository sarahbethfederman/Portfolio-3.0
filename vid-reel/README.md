<h2>Summary</h2>
This is part of an interactive exhibit that loops through interview videos created by my classmates. The interviews
feature prominent individuals that are part of the New Media Design major's history. The website is meant to work w/
mouse interaction but also function well on a static display.

<h2>Tech used:</h2>
- Browserify for module loading & dependency management
- Sass (scss) for styling
- Firebase for the backend (database)
